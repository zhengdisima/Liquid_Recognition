# Liquid_Recognition
Mechanical-electric Dual Characteristics Solid-liquid Interfacing Sensor for Accurate Liquid Identification

Here, we propose a high accuracy liquid identification strategy that integrates water droplet mechanics and solid-liquid interface contact electrification. Through the design of double-stacked devices, triboelectric signals are able to be decoupled into mechanical and contact electrification dual-mode signals. With the integration of a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model, intelligent identification of ten kinds of liquids has reached an ultrahigh accuracy, opening up a pathway for portable liquid monitoring.
